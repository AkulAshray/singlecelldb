The recent advent of single-cell transcriptional profiling using RNA sequencing is enabling the identification of novel human cell types at an unprecedented rate, and published single-cell datasets are rich resources for investigators who want to address questions not originally asked by the creators of the datasets. However, the main challenge resides in making these large-scale datasets to be comparable and reusable in a different context. We aim to develop new deep learning algorithms and architectures that allow seamless integratation and analysis of single-cell data from a myriad of experiments, therefore addressing variability from batches, experimental protocols, bioinformatics protocols, etc. This is a challenge that has appeared previously in biomedical research but the greater scale imposed by high trhroughput single-cell data makes existing solutions unsuitable.

The Cell Ontology [CL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cl) is a biomedical ontology developed to provide this standard reference nomenclature for in vivo cell types in humans and major model organisms

[Uberon](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/uberon) is an integrated cross-species anatomy ontology representing a variety of entities classified according to traditional anatomical criteria such as structure, function and developmental lineage. The ontology includes comprehensive relationships to taxon-specific anatomical ontologies, allowing integration of functional, phenotype and expression data.

Create a single-cell RNA-seq database for the collection and storage of the data and meta-data of existing blood-associated studies in mouse and human.

We are aware of other single-cell databases, however, those databases are not aimed to allow the integration of all single-cell data but mainly as an explorative tool. It is planned that by the of this research the following aspects of the database will be completed:

- Database with metadata and processed data, semantically enabled by the Cell Ontology

- Protocols implemented for automatic update of the database
